          <h3>Project description</h3>
          <p>I am excited to announce that I am developing an eCommerce application for a Colombian company that sells fans for industry and homes. With my expertise in MERN stack, I am creating an intuitive and user-friendly platform that will enable you to browse and purchase products with ease. This eCommerce app will include a range of features, including product categories, search functionality, shopping cart, and secure payment options. I will also prioritize responsive design, ensuring that the app is optimized for all devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. I am dedicated to providing a seamless shopping experience, and I am committed to delivering a high-quality application that meets all their needs. I look forward to bringing this project to life and providing users with an exceptional online shopping experience.</p>
